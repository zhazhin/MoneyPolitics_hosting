# oTree Project for Kristian-Lopez Vargas/Louis Putterman
Programmer: Marco Gutierrez

Project folder for the research projects I've programmed for Kristian-Lopez Vargas (UCSC)/Louis Putterman (Brown University). The apps are git submodules so depending on the privacy level of the repo in which each of them are located, you can access the apps from here.
